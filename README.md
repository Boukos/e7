# This is e7
## This repo is dedicated to host materials for Introduction to Python CSCI E-7

I taught this material in 2017 at Harvard University.
I will share all presentations and my jupyter notebooks.
CSCI E-29 students or anyone interested in learning Python may benefit from these materials.
They may be a bit dry without recorded lectures, but I plan on hosting some Youtube videos in the future to go over them.

The CSCI E-7 staff for 2017 was:

* Nenad Svrzikapa (Instructor)
* Kaleigh Douglas (TF)
* Joe Palin (TF)
* Lenna Hajar (TF)
* Alan Xie (TF)
* Jose Herran (TF)

We used Zed Shaw's book Learning Python The Hard Way, but converted code to Python 3.
